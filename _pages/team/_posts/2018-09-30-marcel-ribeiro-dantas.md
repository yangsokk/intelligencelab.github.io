I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at Institut Curie (PSL Research University and Sorbonne Université) analyzing cause-effect networks in Breast Cancer datasets. I have obtained my Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics (IMD/UFRN) while researching the transcriptional regulatory network of Ewing's Sarcoma.

My research was able to uncover potential master regulators, pointing out putative predictors of patient outcome and potential treatment targets. Regarding my graduate certificate degree in Big Data (IMD/UFRN), my thesis discussed the transcriptional regulatory networks of cancers. As for my Computer and Automation Engineering degree, I wrote a thesis on the development of a homecare monitoring system for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and also worked with artificial intelligence applied to lung cancer, among other things.

Currently, my interests are causality, cancer, information theory, network discovery and statistical inference.
