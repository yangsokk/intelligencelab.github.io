I am a current PhD student at the RT2Lab, U932 team. I am working on assessing the impact of co-medications on breast cancer relapse using the SNDS (French social security) data.

A major challenge of the projet is to develop algorithms to extract structured data from Electronic Health Records. The identification of relapses especially requires Machine Learning techniques. I am also working on drug clustering through unsupervised learning and description of altered patientsâ€™ care trajectories.
